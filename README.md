# PokeGuess

<p>A fun pokemon guessing game. Select from first or second generation pokemon and recieve a random pokemon silhouette from that generation.
If you can correctly guess the name of that pokemon you get to catch it! Once a pokemon in its orginal form is caught it unlocks the ability 
to catch its shiny form.</p>
